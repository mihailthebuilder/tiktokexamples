Let's quickly unpack why these posts are so successful.

Quizzes have high engagement rates by their inherent nature. Viewers will always try answering the questions
if they think they can (that's why the questions are so simple!). And they'll wait until
the end of the video to see whether they got it right.

They'll feel proud and amazed if their answer was correct:

  alt="People commenting in a TikTok post that they got the answer right."
/>

If they get it wrong, they'll be mad or amused:

  alt="People commenting in a TikTok post that they got the answer wrong."
/>

Either way, these posts will cause a strong emotional response, leading to a lot of likes and comments. This ticks
all the boxes for the TikTok algorithm.
