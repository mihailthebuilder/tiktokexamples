Welcome to our TikTok-centric blog! Here, we'll share bite-sized posts filled with valuable insights to elevate your TikTok game - all digestible in 2 minutes or less.

## Who are we

I say "we", but really it's just one person at the moment ðŸ˜…. Hi! I'm Mihail and I'm based in the UK, the land of ðŸ‘‘, â˜”, and ðŸ«–.

I've decided to start this blog as a form of self-therapy. I find posting on TikTok very daunting, and I get depressed quickly when I'm not getting any views on my videos. By posting here, I can pat myself on the back because I've learned something new!

## Why should I bother reading this?

I know there is already quite a lot of educational content out there for TikTok. The platform even has its [own course](https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/getting-started-on-tiktok/tiktok-university/)!

But I have a very short attention span (blaming TikTok for it), and I don't feel like there is a website where I can learn about TikTok by reading short pieces of content. So I figured I should make one ðŸ’ª

Like the concept? Stay tuned for the blog posts then!
