They're so beautiful that I want to start collecting them myself. And I don't even smoke!

Now you're probably thinking this post is pointless because you don't
have a collection of lighters. But you might have gathered up something else that's interesting to
people! Just do a few videos about it and see how it goes. As Jad shows, you don't need to have
some special setting in order to gain hundreds of millions of views on TikTok.
