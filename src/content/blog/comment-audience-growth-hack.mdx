If the TikTok algorithm is just not working for you, here is one way
to get around it: write viral comments on other people's viral posts.

I discovered the hack when [analyzing this video](/blog/jumping-on-reesa-teesa-trend)
that went viral:

  <blockquote

Simple, short, funny. I felt compelled to check out some of their videos.
Even ended up liking a couple.

Obviously not everyone will do this. But if you manage to funnel through
even 10%, that's enough to get the algorithm to start paying attention
to your content.
