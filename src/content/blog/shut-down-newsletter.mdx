After running this TikTok content ideas newsletter for 2 months, I've decided to shut it down. I'm going to spend some time
here explaining why, then talk about the next steps.

## Assumptions...

Before I started working on the newsletter, I wrote down several assumptions that would determine
whether I keep at it:

1/ It would be easy to grow subscribers because people would eagerly share its contents.

2/ My primary audience would be social media managers at major consumer brands (eg L'Oreal).

3/ I'd be able to monetize the newsletter using ads.

4/ I'd make enough money off it to cover my expenses (I live in the UK).

Unfortunately none of these assumptions turned out to be true.

## ...vs reality

While I managed to convince 50 people to subscribe (thank you all!), the far majority
came from a couple of posts on Reddit and Hacker News. I don't see a way to replicate
the success with these posts - both platforms are notorious for their aversion to excessive
content marketing.

I haven't had people spreading the word about this newsletter, either. So I knew I'd be in
for a slog marketing-wise.

The other thing I came to realise was that most of my audience consists of people
starting off on TikTok. It's not worth it for brands to invest time in growing their
accounts organically - they're better off doing ads or influencer partnerships.

The only way I could generate revenue with this type of audience is by selling
courses. But I can't do that with a clear conscience because I haven't had success
on the platform.

## To recap

Was I naive with the assumptions? Definitely! It was my first time running a newsletter,
after all. And I only saw the success stories online. It always looks easy doesn't it :)

## What's next?

I'm thinking of building a website
where you can use GPT-4 without having to pay for the subscription.

Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
