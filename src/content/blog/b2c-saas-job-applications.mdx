You wouldn't think that marketing of SaaS products can work on TikTok.
[aiApply](https://aiapply.com/) is proving that it is possible.

The founder posted a video on his personal account that just shows someone

The reason this video was so successful is that it made people feel like
they've discovered a cheat code to something that's very important in their lives:
job hunting!

It was effective, too. 6 months after going viral on TikTok, they
were able to gain 50 thousand users.
