If you want to become a hit on TikTok, the only thing you should ask yourself
is whether your content resonates with a lot of people. You don't have to be unique,
you don't need fancy editing.

Liam Stapleton is a perfect example - here's a post of his that fetched **11 million views**:

It's obviously hilarious. But there's something equally important that contributed
to the virality of his videos - the fact that more than half a billion people know about
Harry Potter.

Everything else doesn't matter. The props? A wand, scotch tape, and a bald
wig cap. The setting? A plain, modern flat. As low-budget as it gets.
