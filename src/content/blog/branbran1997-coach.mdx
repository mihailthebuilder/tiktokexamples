The general advice on social media is to avoid constantly talking about your brand. Experts recommend
you all sorts of alternatives, like showing the story behind the product, or making entertainment
the main focus of your content.

Let me show you someone who goes against that advice: [Brandong Nguyen](https://www.tiktok.com/@branbran1997).
All he does is post videos displaying the bags in the Coach store he works in.

Here's one of his videos that got more than **6 million views**:

That's his entire content strategy.

Why does it work? Well, many ladies love shopping for bags. And they love talking about them too.
So with his videos, Brandon creates a place where they can do both of those things.
