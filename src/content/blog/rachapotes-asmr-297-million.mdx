It doesn't get more basic than recording how you've let various glass bottles and jars roll down stairs.
Yet rachapotes managed to get **297 million views** from one such video:

Even though you know it's silly, you can't stop watching it. Why is that?

It's been engrained in your mind that you should try to avoid this from happening.
So when you see those bottles falling down the marble stairs, you get the feeling that
you're watching something taboo.

The sight and sound of the glass containers breaking will give you goosebump sensations.
This ASMR at its finest.
