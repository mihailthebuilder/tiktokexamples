If you have an older phone, you're probably worried that the quality of the videos you make with it won't be good enough for TikTok. The actual answer is that it depends. Here's a quick rundown to help you decide if it's worth upgrading your phone:

## 1. Assess your current phone

Find out the specs on your phone's selfie camera. I recommend looking for them on [GSM Arena](https://www.gsmarena.com/) - make sure you pick the right phone model, it can be pretty easy to make a mistake these days (Realme 12 Pro vs Realme 12 Pro+ ðŸ™„).

Check out the resolution and the frames per second (fps) on the video. They need to be 1080p/30fps at a minimum.

Also, record a selfie and examine it by yourself. Pay attention to factors such as video sharpness (especially in motion), audio clarity, and color.

## 2. Assess your situation on TikTok

For those who are just starting out or haven't yet built a sizable audience, the quality of your videos shouldn't be a top priority. People care way more about the content. Focus on nailing that if your phone already meets the baseline.

Even if you're gaining traction, it still might not be worth investing in a new mobile device. TikTok caps video quality at a very low level - 1080p/60fps. The best smartphones will still offer some benefits, especially around the crispness of the videos in low light, but it rarely matters.

## Conclusion

Simply focus on creating engaging content for TikTok rather than worrying about upgrading your phone, as meeting the minimum 1080p/30fps standard should be sufficient considering the platform's limitations. Quality matters, but creativity reigns supreme.
