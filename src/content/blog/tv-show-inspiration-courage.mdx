You don't have to come up with something totally original to be a TikTok comedy hit.
Just take something from pop culture and do your own remix of it.

This is what [crayron](https://www.tiktok.com/@crayron) did:

He replays a memorable scene in the
[King Ramses Curse](https://courage.fandom.com/wiki/King_Ramses) episode from Courage the Cowardly Dog.
It's ridiculously funny! Which is why it got **8 million views**.

He made 3 more videos on the cartoon series, which yielded him another **8 million views**. With very little
spending on the props - he's wrapping himself in toilet paper, after all!
