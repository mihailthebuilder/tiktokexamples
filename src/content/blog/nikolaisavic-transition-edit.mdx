2 videos, 4.5 seconds each. One is a video of a guy about to eat
his powdered sugar cake in a cafe. Another is a stock video of a snowy mountain.

Sounds as boring as it gets right? Well, Nikolai Savic combined the two and
fetched **175 million** views. Here's the result:

Nikolai has produced so many of these hits that he's actually reached **1 billion views**.
And he's not even based in the States! He hails from Germany, so the TikTok algorithm
will tend to push his content to a smaller audience.

What makes the videos so special? As you would've noticed, it's those sick transitions
from 2 recordings that are so far apart from each other in terms of content. This is creativity
at its finest - the ability to take mundane things and turn them into eye-popping videos.

But he wasn't the inventor of this content idea. [Zach King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_King)
is thought to be the pioneer. Nikolai put his own spin on it. And so can you!
