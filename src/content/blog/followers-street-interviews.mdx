[John Rusanov's](https://www.tiktok.com/@johnrusanov) strategy is simple: come up with an
interesting question, then walk around and shoot videos asking people that question.
And it works really well. He gets 2 million views on average. PER VIDEO.

Let's check out one of his posts to see why it's so addictive:

The reason these street interviews are so compelling is because they satisfy our curiosity
about the lives and thoughts of those we pass by every day. John also makes sure he
uses the right questions; he knows people are interested in questions about wealth, looks, or
those that lead to funny answers.

So what's holding you back? Grab a camera buddy and go do some interviews!
