Welcome to the latest issue of this magnificent newsletter.
With your host, Mihail, who's willing to sacrifice his sanity to bring you
the weird and wonderful things that go viral on TikTok.

Here are the 3 short posts I've written up this week:

1. [How Duolingo takes advantage of viral trends to fill up its content calendar](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/duolingo-arab-mom-viral-trend/)
2. [Startup investor gets rewarded with 46 million views for video where he fulfills someone's dream](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/simonsquibb-business-dream/)
3. [Taking off with hilarious, low-budget Harry Potter impersonations](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/mrliamstapleton-liam-stapleton-harry-potter/)

Do you have any suggestions for growing this newsletter by the way?
Send them across, I've run out of ideas Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
