title: "Fo', fo', fo"

Was the first thing that came up to mind when I thought
of the magical issue number 4 that this newsletter has reached.
It's an <a href="https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/05/31/fo-fo-fo-76ers-moses-malone-playoff-prediction" style="display:inline-block;">NBA reference</a> (۶ૈ ᵒ \_ᵒ)۶ૈ=͟͟͞͞ 🏀

I digress, back to what this should be about - the
3 articles that were released this week:

- [An Italian pastry chef who does 20 million views PER VIDEO](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/pastrychef-am-italian-baker/)
- [Anonymous account that records themselves pinch zooming on Google Maps has amassed 500 million views](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/googlemapsfun-google-maps/)
- [How a TikTok creator smoothly embedded an ad into his content](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/johnrusanov-gauth-ad/)

As always, hit me up if you have any feedback. I'm desperately trying to figure out how to grow this newsletter.

Peace out ✌(◕‿-)✌
