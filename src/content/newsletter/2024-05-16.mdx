title: "I'm giving up (oT-T)å°¸"

After running the newsletter for 2 months, I've decided to shut it down. I'm going to spend some time
here explaining why, then talk about the next steps.

## Assumptions...

Before I started working on the newsletter, I wrote down several assumptions that would determine
whether I keep at it:

- It would be easy to grow subscribers because people would eagerly share its contents.
- My primary audience would be social media managers at major consumer brands (eg L'Oreal).
- I'd be able to monetize the newsletter using ads.
- I'd make enough money off it to cover my expenses (I live in the UK).

Unfortunately none of these assumptions turned out to be true.

## ...vs reality

While I managed to convince 50 people to subscribe (thank you all!), the far majority
came from a couple of posts on Reddit and Hacker News. I don't see a way to replicate
the success with these posts - both platforms are notorious for their aversion to excessive
content marketing.

I haven't had people spreading the word about this newsletter, either. So I knew I'd be in
for a slog marketing-wise.

The other thing I came to realise was that most of my audience consists of people
starting off on TikTok. It's not worth it for brands to invest time in growing their
accounts organically - they're better off doing ads or influencer partnerships.

The only way I could generate revenue with this type of audience is by selling
courses. But I can't do that with a clear conscience because I haven't had success
on the platform.

## To recap

Was I naive with the assumptions? Definitely! It was my first time running a newsletter,
after all. And I only saw the success stories online. It always looks easy doesn't it :)

## Next steps

I'm going to repurpose this email as a blog post and
remove the subscribe now call-to-action on the website.

The email list will stay for a couple of months, just in case I'm struck with an
idea of how to make the newsletter work, after which I'll delete it. You're
obviously welcome to unsubscribe right now - [here's the link](link).

What's next? I'm thinking of building a website
where you can use GPT-4 without having to pay for the subscription.
If you're interested, just reply to this email.

Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
