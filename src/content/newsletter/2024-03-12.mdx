Here are the 3 things I've written about over the past week:

- [A faceless account which generated 297 million views with a single ASMR video](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/rachapotes-asmr-297-million/)
- [Bagging 4 million views per video reenacting scenes from a cartoon classic](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/tv-show-inspiration-courage/)

That's all folks! Any feedback? Just reply :)
