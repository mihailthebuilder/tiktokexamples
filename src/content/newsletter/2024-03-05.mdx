Welcome to the first issue of this newsletter! I'm sure someone will
[make an NFT out of it](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/14/twitter-nft-jack-dorsey-sina-estavi)
in the future.

I'll keep it short and sweet. Here are links to the TikTok video ideas I've written about over
the past week:

- [A B2C SaaS app that helps people apply for jobs using AI went viral on TikTok.](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/b2c-saas-job-applications)
- [How John Rusanov gained 4 million followers just by interviewing strangers on the street.](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/followers-street-interviews)
- [Getting involved in the Reesa Teesa trend got a TikToker 3 million views on a video; he was averaging 5 thousand before.](https://tiktokexamples.com/blog/jumping-on-reesa-teesa-trend)

You might be wondering why I'm not including the contents of the blog posts in the email.
It's because I can't embed videos here.

That's it for this issue. Reply to this email if you have any feedback, I'm still figuring things out (=˃ᆺ˂=)
